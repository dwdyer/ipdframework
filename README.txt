IPD Framework
(C) Copyright 2004-2012 Daniel W. Dyer

This project consists of code I wrote to support my masters thesis, "Opponent
Modelling and Strategy Evolution in the Iterated Prisoner's Dilemma", at the
School of Computer Science and Software Engineering at the University of
Western Australia in 2004.  A chapter in the book "The Iterated Prisoners'
Dilemma: 20 Years On", pubished by World Scientific in 2007, was also partly
based on this work.

The code in this project has been updated slightly since 2004 but it mostly
remains in its original less-than-perfect state.  It was my intention to
replace the primitive evolution engine with the Watchmaker Framework
(http://watchmaker.uncommons.org) but I've never got around to it.

attempt to reproduce the results from the above publications or use it for their
own IPD experiments.
